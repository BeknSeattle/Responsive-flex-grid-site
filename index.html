          <p>With less and less time to study, I have been practising Javascript again. I am going through forEach versus for...of loop, trying to figure out which is bestâ€”troubleshooting the basics. And how to print every single id element as a navigation link.</p>          
          <p>It doesn't sound straightforward, but when your starting to create the project, it becomes more straightforward. And you are starting to figure out that the append method is a friend.</p>

          <h3>Lesson 1: <span>The beautiful Grid System</span></h3>
          <p>Always have a containing element/parent selector to house your display: grid. This is where you need specify the properties; grid-template-column and grid-template-rows.</p>
          <p>Note that the code snippet below for the class grid-wrapper selector have the property grid-template-columns with the repeat() value. This simple syntax will automatically adjust the grid by filling-up its parent container.</p>

          <p>I dedicate all the things I learn to the Almighty, as all knowledge comes from him. All wisdom comes from him. We are wise when we follow his words. All my hard work is for my husband who despite his sickness, fights to live and never stops praising the living God, Jesus! To you, all the praise and Glory! Thank you to all the nurses and doctors. Nothing is impossible with God. Glory to Jesus!</p>
