This is done by using Flex Box and Css Grid. 
This template is based on the lesson learned from Zero to Mastery course in Udemy and Udacity.

# Auto Populates the Nav bar links
The Navigation bar auto-populates. Creating the HTML <section> Tag with the id attribute auto-creates the navigation links.
The Last element child of every navigation link will have a class, ".push". The class "push" will force the last li element on the right side of the navigation bar.
